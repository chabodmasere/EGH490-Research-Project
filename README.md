## Overview

This repository documents the research, modelling, simulation, design, prototyping, and validation work completed for the **EGH490 Research Project** at the **Queensland University of Technology (QUT)**.

The project investigated the effectiveness of **arrays of slots radiating through truncated waveguides** as a method for suppressing unwanted **second-order lobes** in antenna radiation patterns. These lobes arise when the aperture field distribution departs from the ideal excitation profile, causing power to radiate into unintended directions and reducing beam purity, gain efficiency, and angular discrimination.

The completed work represents a full engineering research workflow, progressing from single-slot electromagnetic behaviour to array-level synthesis, CAD development, physical prototyping, and validation-oriented analysis.

---

## Research Aim

The central aim of this project was to determine whether controlled slot placement and cavity-backed/truncated waveguide geometry could reduce second-order lobe formation while maintaining acceptable impedance matching and radiation performance.

The project focused on:

* Understanding slot excitation in rectangular waveguides
* Modelling the relationship between slot offset, resonance, and self-admittance
* Investigating cavity-backed slot behaviour
* Evaluating aperture field uniformity in amplitude and phase
* Suppressing second-order lobes in the far-field radiation pattern
* Translating simulated geometry into manufacturable prototypes
* Validating analytical and simulated predictions through structured design iteration

---

## Technical Background

Waveguide slot arrays are widely used in radar, aerospace, satellite communication, and high-frequency antenna systems due to their high efficiency, mechanical robustness, and ability to generate controlled radiation patterns.

However, truncated waveguide structures and non-ideal aperture distributions can produce unwanted radiation peaks. These second-order lobes may arise due to:

* Abrupt aperture truncation
* Non-uniform slot excitation
* Phase error across the slot array
* Mutual coupling between neighbouring slots
* Higher-order field behaviour inside the waveguide or cavity
* Poorly controlled slot spacing, offset, or geometry

This project investigated these effects using a combined analytical, numerical, and prototype-driven workflow.

---

## Methodology

The research followed a structured engineering process:

### 1. Literature Review

Review of waveguide slot arrays, cavity-backed slots, truncated apertures, sidelobe suppression, and array synthesis methods.

### 2. Single-Slot Modelling

Development of single-slot CST models to study resonance, self-admittance, slot offset, slot length, and coupling behaviour.

### 3. Parametric Sweeps

Systematic variation of slot and cavity parameters, including offset, length, width, cavity size, and truncation geometry.

### 4. Admittance Extraction

Extraction and comparison of conductance and susceptance behaviour to identify resonant slot configurations.

### 5. Aperture Field Analysis

Investigation of electric field magnitude and phase distribution across the slot and cavity aperture.

### 6. Array Synthesis

Extension from single-slot behaviour to multi-slot array behaviour using excitation control and array-factor principles.

### 7. Radiation Pattern Evaluation

Assessment of gain, directivity, sidelobe levels, and second-order lobe suppression.

### 8. CAD Development and Prototype Fabrication

Translation of simulated waveguide and slot-array geometries into manufacturable CAD models. Prototype components were developed for additive manufacturing using a **Bambu Lab X1C Carbon 3D printer**, enabling rapid iteration of waveguide bodies, cavity layers, and slot-array structures.

### 9. Validation and Verification

Comparison of simulation results with measurement-oriented expectations, including S-parameter behaviour, impedance characteristics, aperture-field behaviour, and radiation pattern performance.

## Key Engineering Questions

This project was structured around several core engineering questions:

* How does slot offset affect resonant conductance and susceptance?
* How does a cavity-backed configuration modify the active slot admittance?
* Can cavity geometry improve aperture field uniformity?
* How much phase variation across the aperture is acceptable before radiation performance degrades?
* What geometric parameters most strongly influence second-order lobe formation?
* Can a truncated waveguide slot array achieve meaningful lobe suppression while remaining manufacturable?
* How effectively can additive manufacturing support early-stage waveguide antenna prototyping?
* How closely can CST simulation predictions be aligned with analytical expectations and physical prototype behaviour?

## Prototype Development

A major component of this completed research was the transition from simulated electromagnetic models to physical prototype geometries.

The prototype workflow involved:

* Exporting waveguide and slot-layer geometries from CAD
* Preparing print-ready files for additive manufacturing
* Fabricating early-stage prototypes using the **Bambu Lab X1C Carbon**
* Assessing physical geometry, tolerances, slot definition, and assembly fit
* Using printed prototypes to support design iteration before final metallic fabrication

The use of additive manufacturing enabled rapid evaluation of complex truncated waveguide geometries before committing to more expensive metallic manufacturing processes.
